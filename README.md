- 👋 Hi, I’m @Malekal4699
- 👀 I’m interested in computers, reading, programming, DnD, scifi, food, spicy stuff... lots of stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... everyday! at work, in my free time, from my kids, from my dog...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on foundry VTT. I love adapting quests, adding the walls, trying to figure how to make it as cool as possible while keeping from being too cumbersome.
- 📫 How to reach me here, or on discord, Malekal#9985.
